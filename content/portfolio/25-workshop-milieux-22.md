<!--more-->

This two-day workshop aims at developing technical and personal skills in users and potential users of machine learning in creative contexts in general, and sound and music in particular. The sessions will include an introduction to the machine learning (ML) paradigm and human agency in creative AI; supervised, unsupervised, and generative ML approaches; and music research-creation projects using machine learning tools. Some of the tools that will be covered in the sessions are: Wekinator, AudioStellar, R-VAE, and RAVE.

The workshop is designed to appeal to any artist, student, or creator using music or sound as a plastic material for (part of) their work and creative practice. This group includes sound and electronic music artists, and also intermedia and mixed media artists.
