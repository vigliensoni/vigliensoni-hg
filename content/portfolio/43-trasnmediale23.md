Sound design for Holy Waters

<!--more-->

Artist Antonia Hernández commissioned me the design of the soundscape for her site-specific installation _Hydrofiction 01: Holy Waters_.

Her hydrofiction attempts to counteract the commodification of water by means of a poetic performative gesture. She travelled to Chicago and took water from the University of Chicago School of Economics—where Chilean economists were indoctrinated on neoliberal doctrines fifty years ago. She then brought the water to Petorca—One of Chile’s driest valley due an extended drought and avocado farming depleting the scarce water resources.

The artist asked me to create a site-specific soundscape to be rendered at a long corridor at the Akademie der Künste in Berlin. The space is a 22-meter long corridor intervened with vinyl print cutouts with poems, a 2-channel video projection, and sound.

The premise for the sound design was _to create a soundscape reminiscent of a river or stream, that has a soothing effect, but if you pay attention, it is made out of sounds related to money_.

We discussed the sonic materials and came up with ideas about stream and river torrents, the sound of a dry river, raindrops, bubbles, subsonic drops, spinning coins, bill counting, gaming sounds, and financial markets. These elements can be seen in a draft of the graphical score for the soundscape in the following image. Left to right is time, and height is spatial position in the space.

The audience would walk along the long corridor, and so, upon walking into it there would be no feeling of left and right, but front and back. This characteristic gave me the idea of trying to immerse the audience into a stream of sounds, where all the elements would travel from back to front. As if they were pulled by the the flow of water towards the end of the corridor where the two-channel video projection was happening. 

Speakers were arranged for this setup as shown in the next figure. Full-range speakers (FR sp) are blue, subwoofers (sub) are pink, and directional speaker and acoustic mirrors are located close to the screens.

The speaker in close to the screens is a high-directional speaker facing an acoustic mirror that hangs freely from the ceiling. Changes in air flow due to audience movement in the space make the mirror turn, reflecting the sound beam across the full corridor.
