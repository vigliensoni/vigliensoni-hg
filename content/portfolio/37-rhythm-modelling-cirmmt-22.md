CIRMMT. Montréal, QC.


<!--more-->

On September 14th, 2022, I gave an invited presentation talk at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research on Music Media and Technology in the context of their Seminar Series [(link to the site)](https://www.cirmmt.org/en/events/seminars/gabriel-vigliensoni/).

The abstract of the talk was:

In this talk, I will present the development of Clastic Music, a set of musical pieces where I play with the geological concept of a clast: new entities and forms created out of pre-existing fragments. Clastic Music is the result of rhythmic explorations using a machine learning-assisted approach to music-making. To create these rhythmic clasts, I designed a software device that can learn models from small-size datasets of drum patterns and embed them into rhythmic latent spaces. To facilitate the exploration of the models, the device provides a visualizer that generates a dynamic representation of the latent spaces and is based directly on the pulsing rhythmic patterns encoded in the models. Clastic Music was premiered live at the MUTEK festival in Montréal and was packaged as a web-based release, where visuals are rendered in real time on the browser and depend on user and sound input.
