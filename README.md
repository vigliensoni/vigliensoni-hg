## Install hugo

For some reason, the `latest` hugo version (0.128.1) at the moment, doesn't compile on the local machine or GitHub pages. 

The version properly running of which I'm aware of is 0.99.1. To install ir with `brew`:

- [Find the right version](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/777055ad49312e59d0776aa8e54f81c5759e70f5/Formula/hugo.rb)
- Download to local machine as `hugo.rb`
- Install it as `brew install hugo.rb`
